# Create Your Frisk - Lua moddable Undertale engine

Welcome to the Git repository for **Create Your Frisk**, a fork of [**Unitale**](https://github.com/lvk/Unitale/) by lvk!

When testing, you'll want to load the Disclaimer scene from the Scenes folder.

Editing the Overworld requires **Unity** (see **Unity Version** below).

We also have a [**Discord server**](https://discord.gg/GFJ5277)! Feel free to check it out if you want to be in touch with Unitale and Create Your Frisk's community!
